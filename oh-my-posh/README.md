# oh-my-posh Configuration Script

## Usage

Download this folder and run `.\terminal.ps1` in PowerShell

That's all.

:)

## Customization

If u want to customize your own prompt, u can edit `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` and `.\themes\*.json` to make it.

Run `notepad $PROFILE` to edit `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` and run `Get-PoshThemes` to see all themes.

The default theme i use is `1_shell`, if u want to make ur own theme, u should run `explorer C:\Users\$env:UserName\AppData\Local\oh-my-posh\themes\` and create a new json file to make ur own theme.
